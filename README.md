🏥 Project Title
Cashless Radar – Eliminating the “Blind Walk” into Healthcare
🚨 Problem Statement
The “Blind Walk” into Healthcare
Patients often walk into hospitals blindly. They may have a valid health insurance policy and a doctor’s prescription, yet they lack clarity on whether the hospital, treatment, and insurance policy actually align.
This results in multiple critical challenges:
Financial Anxiety
Patients are unsure whether a hospital will accept their insurance or demand large upfront payments (often ₹1–₹2 lakhs), causing stress during already vulnerable moments.
Operational Chaos at Hospitals
Patients arrive at Third Party Administrator (TPA) desks without complete or correct documents, leading to delays in treatment and administrative bottlenecks.
Information Asymmetry
Hospitals know treatment costs
Insurance companies know policy coverage
Patients know neither
This lack of transparent, patient-centric information leads to poor decisions, delayed care, and financial shocks.
💡 Proposed Solution
Three Pillars of Patient Protection
This project flips the healthcare information flow by empowering patients with actionable insights before they step into a hospital.
🧭 Feature A: Active Health Timeline
Instead of scattered medical files and reports, the application presents a chronological health journey:
Copy code

Consultation → Diagnosis → Test Reports → Recommended Procedure
This structured timeline helps:
Patients understand their medical journey
Hospitals access organized case history
Faster and clearer decision-making
🔍 Feature B: Policy Decoder
Patients select their insurance provider (e.g., Star Health, HDFC Ergo).
The system:
Instantly loads the network hospital list
Filters out non-network hospitals
Prevents accidental visits to non-covered facilities
This ensures patients only explore insurance-compatible hospitals.
📡 Feature C: Cashless Radar (Hero Feature)
When a doctor recommends a procedure (e.g., ACL Reconstruction), the user searches it in the app.
The system displays nearby hospitals on a map, color-coded by financial viability:
🟢 Green – Cashless Available
Policy covers the procedure directly. No upfront payment required.
🟡 Yellow – Reimbursement Only
Patient must pay first and claim later.
🔴 Red – Mismatch
Hospital lacks required specialty or insurance tie-up.
This enables informed, stress-free, and financially safe healthcare decisions.
🎯 Impact
Reduces financial shock for patients
Saves time at hospital TPA desks
Improves trust and transparency in healthcare
Encourages smarter hospital selection
